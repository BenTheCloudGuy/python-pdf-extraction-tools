Greetings and welcome to the Player’s Primer for Zyathé, the Wy’rded World! Although this primer 
gives only the briefest glimpse at everything there is to know about Zyathé, it should be enough to get 
you oriented and help you recognize the gods, races, lands, and other features that you will encounter in 
games set in this strange and exciting world. If you’d like to know more about anything presented here, it 
is explored in much greater detail in Volume One of the Player’s Guidebook.

Th e Races of zyathé
AvovA desired that Zyathé should be filled with many different peoples to enjoy and make use of the 
incredibly varied landscapes he had created. Yet he also wished for his creation to emulate his essential 
nature, so he entrusted the gods with the task of bringing forth peoples of their own. As a model for 
their labors, he placed Humankind upon Zyathé. The gods succeeded in creating many new races; some  
remained sequestered away in remote regions, but many spread across the world and thrived.
3Th e R a c e s  o f Z y aTh é
the sarth  
Sarth are a tall, lean folk with skin that ranges from warm 
tones of orange to amber, thick dark hair with a purple hues, 
and pink or blue eyes. Most are remarkably fast and quite 
physically fit. Sarth have a strange reputation as savage-
ly violent and primitive in some regards, while also being 
amongst the most refined and intellectual races in others. 
They are also well known for the fact that they are completely 
incapable of using arcane magic.
the myruun  
Myruun are a somewhat shorter people with smooth, rub-
bery skin of teal or gray-green, wavy white hair, and large 
golden eyes. They are most at home on the seas, lakes, and 
rivers of Zyathé, with a substantial portion of their popula-
tion engaged in fishing, the sea trade, and other waterborne 
professions. They are quite temperamental, prone to rapid 
swings in mood, but rarely holding grudges as a result. Most 
demonstrate a fierce dedication to their craft, while being 
almost flippant regarding most other subjects.
the noble fay’aree  
Noble Fay’aree are short and delicate folk with remarkably 
large eyes and long ears – which others typically find both 
strange and beautiful. There are two feuding houses of this 
race, known as the Light Seelie and Dark Unseelie courts. 
The Seelie Fay’aree are golden skinned with auburn or pink 
hair and small, antler-like horns atop their heads. The Un-
seelie by contrast have skin like dark silver, with light blue or 
white hair, which is parted by small, curled horns like those 
of a ram. Both kindreds are playful and mischievous lords of 
the woodlands, but the Light Fay’aree are friendly and help-
ful, while the Dark Fay’aree are cruel and malicious.
the goruund  
Goruund are extremely large folk, both tall and broad. They 
are heavily muscled and have strong, chiselled features, with 
dark blue-black skin, orange or yellow eyes, and light blue 
to slate gray hair. Almost all Goruund live amongst moun-
tain peaks in small, tightly-knit communities. Goruund have 
remarkably long lives and excellent memories, which often 
gives them a deliberate, cautious attitude when compared 
to other races. Surprisingly to outsiders, Goruund have a re-
markable natural talent for singing, and musical harmony in 
general, which they use to commune with their patron gods 
and the spirits of the natural world.
the aethyr  
Aethyrians are similar in stature and appearance to Hu-
mans, though with a stronger propensity for soft, delicate 
features. They are at greater variance in coloration, with hair, 
skin, and eyes all commonly found in shades of light blues, 
pale violets, and silvery-whites. They are well known for their instinctive command over wind and air and typically live a 
nomadic lifestyle, whether as a small pastoral clan or in one 
of their great migrating cities. Their culture is matriarchal 
in structure, and is governed by a strict, complex hierarchy 
of social obligations. Many Aethyr serve as merchants and 
traders, and they are famed for their creation of the magnif-
icent sky-ships.
humans  
Humans were the only race created by AvovA, and were held 
as an example and inspiration for the gods in the creation 
of their own peoples. In their youthful arrogance the new -
ly birthed deities believed that they could surpass the works 
of their maker, and their labors were indeed impressive and 
quite pleasing to AvovA. Nevertheless, Humankind proved to 
still be the most dynamic and adaptable of peoples on Zyathé, 
and as such is the most numerous, widespread, and diverse 
race on the Life World. Distinct Human ethnicities have aris-
en on each of the major continents, each of which has further 
diversified and spread across the world to create a nearly un-
countable array of Human, and half-Human, communities.
half-orcs  
Half-Orcs are the children of Humans and Orcs, and typically 
favor their Orcish ancestry in displaying prodigious strength, 
pronounced jawlines, and bold facial features. Their skin can 
vary considerably in color, from green to gray to chestnut, 
while yellow eyes are most common, and their hair tends to-
wards dark red or brown. Half-Orcs often struggle to make 
their way in the world, usually distrusted by Humans and 
other “civilized” races, while being oppressed and exploited 
by Orcs. In spite of these hardships, many Half-Orcs learn to 
control their fury and find a place in society, or else channel it 
and demand respect when it isn’t given willingly.
half-ogres  
Only Goruund are likely to overshadow the towering stature 
of Half-Ogres in settled lands. Bulky and strong like their pro-
genitors, they typically have a dusky tan or gray complexion, 
crowned with thick but patchy black or brown hair. Many as-
sume that their heavy features indicate a brutish and simple 
mind, but this is commonly a cruel and inaccurate supposi-
tion. As such, they must perpetually prove themselves to be 
more than dangerous savages.  
high elves  
Once the epitome of refinement and culture, the High Elves 
have fallen far from the heights of glory they once held. Nev -
ertheless, their stunning appearance remains undiminished. 
Most are slightly shorter than Humans, but their fine, pale 
features are framed by silver or golden hair and adorned with 
gem-like eyes. Almost all have shapely figures, and bear the 
distinctive pointed ears common to all Elven folk. Most peo-
4Th e R a c e s  o f Z y aTh éTh e R a c e s  o f Z y aTh é
5
ple of other races cannot help but feel awe in their presence. 
Small, scattered bands of High Elves remain true to their 
resplendent past, but for most their attractive appearance 
hides the disdain, bitterness, and malevolence that have con-
sumed their souls.
wood elves  
Noticeably shorter than their High Elven cousins, Wood Elves 
have a similarly charming appearance, though they usually pos -
sess a much more approachable bearing. Their skin is usually a 
light green shade, reflecting the colors of their sylvan homes. 
Their hair is typically blonde or copper, while their eyes are a 
piercing, deep green or blue. Some describe them as almost 
childlike or Fey in appearance, and in the latter case they are 
correct, as all Elves, and the Wood Elves in particular, are rel -
atives of the Fay’aree. Also like that mischievous kindred, they 
generally prefer to remain beneath the boughs of their wood -
land homes, but the Wood Elves are much more welcoming of 
outsiders and more frequently venture out into other lands.
dark elves  
Long ago entrusted to the care of cruel and wicked gods, the 
Dark Elves have been shaped in body, mind, and soul by many 
ages of depredation. Their skin ranges from dark purple to 
deep gray, easily blending into the gloom of the Underdelve 
where they dwell. Their hair and eyes strongly contrasts with 
this dark coloration, with white, silver, or amber locks and 
burning red, yellow, or orange irises. In spite of these unusu-
al hues, they retain the same regal features of their cousins, 
often catching outsiders that expect evil creatures to have 
crooked, ugly appearances off-guard. However, they rarely 
fail to disappoint in living up to their reputation for cunning 
enmity and sadistic barbarism.ordrin  
Ordrin are descended from Elves and Orcs,  two lineages that 
could scarcely be more different. Oddly, this unusual mixing 
often creates an appearance that people of almost all races find 
remarkably attractive. As the hair, eye, and skin color of both 
Elves and Orcs can vary quite widely, it is not surprising that 
Ordrin display significant diversity in such features, though 
almost all have large, prominently pointed ears and lean, ath-
letic frames.  Similarly, Ordrin can vary widely in personali-
ty, though a strong temper is commonly inherited from the 
Oricsh side of the family. In Orc chiefdoms, Ordrin are rarely 
distinguished from Half-Elves, while in other societies they 
receive a mixture of disdain for their ancestry and admiration 
for their stunning looks.
crown dwarves  
Crown Dwarves are a sturdily built folk, typically standing 
four to five feet tall. Their skin is most often a rich earthy 
tone, with brown, golden, or green eyes and blonde or auburn 
hair, including the distinctive Dwarven trait of prodigious 
beards kept by most males. Most are characterized as stub-
born, ambitious, dependable, and hardworking to the point 
of obsession. Quite likely they are the second most populous 
and influential people on Zyathé after Humankind, a position 
they reached due to their prudence and natural wariness in 
the years preceding the Woe of Ruin. Their dedication to pre-
cision and quality has seen their standards for measurement, 
coinage, and even law widely adopted across the world.
deeping dwarves  
The Deeping Dwarves are fairly similar in stature to their cous -
ins the Crown Dwarves, but typically stand a few inches shorter, 
and tend towards stonier grays rather than warm earth tones Th e R a c e s  o f Z y aTh éTh e R a c e s  o f Z y aTh é
in skin color. They usually sport beards that are as impressive 
as the Crown Dwarves, though their hair ranges into colors like 
blue or purple. In character they seem to have a similar dispo -
sition as well, but taken to dark extremes. They are arrogant, 
neurotic, and cruel, but remain industrious and skillful. No 
other civilized races are known to probe as deeply into the ut -
termost depths of the Underdelve as the Deeping Dwarves, and 
they are quite pleased with the secrecy this provides for their 
activities, whether innocuous, or thoroughly wicked.
high gnomes  
High Gnomes are, in spite of their name, one of the shortest 
races on Zyathé, rarely reaching over three and a half feet tall. 
Their light blue-gray skin contrasts strikingly with their cop-
pery-red hair, eyebrows, and for many males, beards, which 
are all invariably styled in outlandish and amusing ways. 
Their reputation as eager – if slightly unhinged – tinkerers, 
inventors, and innovators is well earned, ensuring they re-
ceive a cautious but genuine welcome almost anywhere they 
go. Though many struggle with a short attention span, High 
Gnomes are often friendly, outgoing, agreeable, and easily ex -
cited – a bright reflection of their dark relatives.
dark gnomes  
For those not particularly familiar with Gnomish folk, Dark 
Gnomes can be difficult to distinguish visually from High 
Gnomes. They share similar gray skin and red hair, though in 
both cases they tend towards somewhat darker shades than 
their earnest relatives. It is in conduct where the two lineages 
vary much more significantly. The Dark Gnomes are no less 
clever or inventive, and are surprisingly sociable given their 
other predilections, but their talents are consistently applied 
towards causing malicious mischief and deadly antics. Such devilry is directed against others where possible, but even 
friends and relatives of their own kind are rarely spared if bet-
ter targets are not available.
halflings  
Halflings usually stand between three and four feet tall, and 
naturally tend towards a portly build. They have curly hair of 
red or blonde, which is matched by hairy patches atop their 
feet. Their skin can range from pale to a dark tan, though al-
most all have an abundance of freckles. Halfling eyes are large 
for their size, and can be found in many different colors. Hal-
flings have an abiding love of peacefully working the land, 
growing crops and raising livestock during the day, while 
putting on many celebrations and taking their ease in the eve-
nings, on weekends, and across many holidays throughout 
the year. Many are struck with a driving wanderlust at some 
point in their life, but gladly return to their agrarian lifestyle 
after whatever adventures they find in the wider world.
soflings  
Soflings are very much of a kind with their Halfling relatives, 
bearing similar proportions and features, including the char -
acteristic hairy feet. They differ in often having much darker 
skin, hair and eyes, but unlike many races that were split into 
rival tribes in ancient times, the Soflings and Halflings remain 
amiable towards one another, and tend to have broadly similar 
personalities. The Soflings have developed a distinct culture 
in one regard, fully embracing the nomadic urge within them 
to perpetually move from town to town. Although they collect 
a dizzying array of friends, lovers, business partners, posses -
sions, and properties in their travels, nothing seems to weigh 
them down. They endlessly trade their goods, deeds, and con -
tacts amongst short-term acquaintances with casual ease.
67Magic  in Zyathé
Magic suffuses every aspect of Zyathé, having been used by AvovA to create the gods, the world, and everything upon and 
within it. The peoples of Zyathé conceive of magic as a great surging river of power known as the Zyanthuus, or more com -
monly, the Everflow, that runs over and through all of creation. There are many traditions and methods used by the mortal 
races to tap into the incredible power of the Everflow, but it remains outside the reach of the vast majority of people.
the everflow  
The Everflow, or Zyanthuus, is the abstraction of arcane power 
used by scholars and magic users to discuss the nearly unfath -
omable source of magic. It was once, when AvovA used it to cre -
ate All Things,  a single unified flow of varied aspects. However, 
in the ensuing millennia, calamities befell which threatened to 
destroy the Everflow, and it was divided into three primary sub -
flows to stabilize it and preserve the order of the world. These 
are The Viviflow, the Prysmaflow, and the Umbraflow. Although 
now separated, mages frequently still call upon the power of 
all three flows in some capacity while casting their spells. The 
power of the Everflow has waxed and waned throughout histo -
ry, but access to even a tiny sliver of its power  has played a vital 
role in virtually every society established upon Zyathé.
the viviflow  
The Viviflow, also known as the Brightflow or Luminuus, is 
the source of Light Magic. This flow is associated with light, 
life, growth, healing, and creation. It is strongly concentrated 
within all living things, and in sources of light like the Sul. The 
followers of Good deities, and those that seek to build up and 
spread civilization favor its use.
the prysmaflow  
The Prysmaflow, also known as the Wildflow or Ferauus, is the 
source of Raw Magic. It is the flow concerned with balance, per -
manence, and the natural cycles of the world. It pools in stones, 
soil, bodies of water, and anywhere the wilderness remains 
largely unspoilt. The Prysmaflow mediates a careful harmony 
between the Viviflow and the Umbraflow, creating an equilibri -
um where the other, much more ephemeral flows may coexist. 
It is favored by followers of Neutral gods, as well as those like 
Druids that venerate the wilds, and by arcane magic users like 
Wizards that do not overly concern themselves with the moral -
ity and philosophy of their spellcasting. 
the umbraflow  
The Umbraflow, also known as the Shadowflow or Dunauus, is the 
source of Dark Magic. It is the stream that embodies darkness, 
entropy, death, cessation, and dissolution. It tends to concentrate 
in graveyards, battlefields, swamps, sewers, and dark caverns far 
beneath the surface. The adherents of Evil gods understandably 
favor the Umbraflow, but there are many less devoted spellcasters 
that revel in destruction that specialize in its use.flowstones  
Flowstones are rare objects that have their origin in a time 
known as the Woe of Ruin, when magic flowed unconstrained 
across the world. These mineral deposits seem similar in ap -
pearance to other gemstones at a casual glance, but are infused 
with potent magic. In their raw form they are extremely haz -
ardous, causing unpredictable maladies in those that spend 
longer than a few moments in close proximity to them. It is 
even more dangerous to attempt to shape them, potentially un -
leashing deadly blasts of inchoate arcane power, but this per -
ilous task is required to transform them into a useable form. 
Uniquely among the peoples of Zyathé, the Sarth are insensate 
to arcane magic, yet this seems to also grant them immunity to 
the deleterious effects of raw flowstones, and associated haz -
ards  of the cutting process. Once a flowstone has been safely 
cut, it can be utilized to grant a wide variety of magical effects 
when ensconced in an appropriate item – depending on the 
color, clarity, and shape of the stone among other factors. The 
Sarth, meanwhile, have learned to expand upon these proper -
ties to create their own form of spellcasting.
the blood-touch  
There is a small but significant number of individuals, perhaps 
one out of every few hundred, found in all lands and among 
all races, that were touched by an errant tributary of magi -
cal power before their birth. This phenomenon is known as a 
Blood-Touch, and it manifests seemingly without following any 
coherent law of gods or nature. It is not passed down from par -
ents to children, and is not more prevalent among any particu -
lar race, class, or gender. The effects of a Blood-Touch typically 
consist of signs both physical and magical, and are usually tied 
to a particular source, such as one of the four elements or a spe -
cific kind of creature, such as dragons or trolls. However, these 
sources remain extremely varied. In most lands, Blood-Touches 
are poorly understood and highly feared, immediately turning 
almost anyone that displays visible indications of one into an 
outcast. Some that have less obvious discolorations or growths 
attempt to hide them, while all must struggle to control the un -
expected powers that plague them. Some manage the stressful 
task of blending into society, while many are simply pushed to 
the margins as pariahs, and still others leave to join the travel -
ing association of Blood-Touched carnival performers known 
as the Hanataz. 8th e Continents of Zyathé
Zyathé is a world covered in vast oceans that separate inhabitable lands into several distinct continents. 
Many similar plants, creatures, and environments can be found spread across multiple continents, but 
many others are singularly found in a particular region, and each landmass possesses many unique quali -
ties. Even though there have been several periods of widespread trade, migration, warfare, and other forms 
of ongoing global contact, each continent has also developed numerous indigenous cultures and traditions 
that are shaped as much by their homeland and history  as interactions with others from distant nations.
verdestia  
Verdestia is a comparatively cool, temperate continent, covered 
in rugged mountains, deciduous forests, cold bogs, rolling hills 
and verdant farmland. It was once a single landmass, but was 
split into a western and an eastern half when its central low -
lands were flooded during the Woe of Ruin. Politically it is split 
between a number of rival sovereignties, republics, and aspiring 
empires, all of which must contend with Orokonoid raiders and 
invaders sailing down from Nordrukka to the north. Halflings 
are natives of Verdestia, but nearly all races have communities 
upon its shores, and it serves as a cosmopolitan hub for global 
exploration and exchange.
sundestia  
Sundestia is a large, hot continent to the south of Verdestia. Its 
western half is well populated and teeming with life, split be -
tween expanses of humid jungle, windswept plains, and fertile 
river basins. The northwest in particular is split between sev -
eral feuding nations, and is home to a wide variety of different 
peoples. Humans are believed to have originated on Sundestia, 
while Soflings are also famous inhabitants of its remarkably 
warm lands. The eastern half of the continent is separated from 
the rest by a massive mountain range, which contains many vol -
canic peaks. On the far side is the bizarre and deadly Du’unsar -
ra Sea, which consists of a vast expanse of a dark mineral sub -
stance, known as murkcrystal. This ‘sea’ is nearly as large as the 
other half of Sundestia, but can only be crossed in specialized 
sailing vessels, as the fine dust acts like a liquid rather than con -
ventional dunes of sand, and any creature unfortunate enough 
to fall into it swiftly sinks to unknown depths.
nordrukka  
Nordrukka is the coldest of the non-polar continents, situated 
between Verdestia and the frigid shores of Ablume. The coastal 
regions maintain hardy prairies, rugged pine forests, and sur -
prisingly temperate fjords, while the interior rises through tun -
dra and barren hills into a spine of snow-capped mountains that 
run the length of the continent. Despite its generally harsh cli -mate, Nordrukka manages to sustain a significant population, 
primarily of the native Orokonoids and Gargantuan races, but 
with significant numbers of other races that have primarily been 
taken as slaves from other lands. Skirmishes over the best terri -
tories are nearly constant between the Chiefdoms that compose 
Nordrukka’s political landscape. Few of these last more than a 
handful of generations, and their influence can change dramat -
ically in that time, but there are always eager warlords ready to 
stake their own claims when old regimes collapse.
estrenia  
Estrenia is the largest of the northern continents, and lies to the 
east of Verdestia and Nordrukka. Although the northerly regions 
are quite cold, the rest of the continent is relatively warm for 
its latitude. Quite geographically diverse, Estrenia has deserts, 
steppes, marshes, and many other features, but is dominated by 
vast forests and some of the most fertile plains on Zyathé. These 
rich fields feed a significantly larger population than any other 
continent, with more than enough left over to trade abroad and 
store in reserves for hard times. Estrenia is the native homeland 
of the Aethyrian race, who wander the eastern steppes. The rest 
of the continent is dominated by a few large empires that each 
consist of a number of different peoples and cultures.
zustrenia  
Zustrenia is a sizable continent to the south of Estrenia and east 
of Sundestia. Except for its southern reaches it is a hot and hu -
mid land, though still somewhat milder than its neighbor Sun -
destia. It has scorching deserts and wet lowlands covered in tall 
grass, but the majority of the landmass is covered in dense for -
ests and jungles. The Sarth people are native to Zustrenia, while 
Humans and many other races common to the other continents 
are only relatively recent arrivals to its shores. The Sarth primar -
ily live in a central valley that is surrounded by tall mountains, 
while the new colonists have formed several city-states around a 
large bay in the northeast. Magical corruption has recently been 
spreading along the western coast, almost certainly originating 
from nearby Cruxxe.9zinn  
Zinn is a small continent to the south of Zustrenia. Its northern 
region is covered in jungle, while the center is thought to be tem -
perate, and the south is likely quite cold. However, it is difficult 
to discern the continent’s characteristics with much certainty; 
the seas around it are exceptionally treacherous and seem to 
turn ships away with strong currents and strange winds when 
not sinking them outright. Those few that have managed to land 
on its shores are often beset with crippling diseases, and expe -
ditions away from the coast rarely return. As such, it remains a 
mystery to most, and has few permanent residents, or at least 
there are few known to the outside world.
cruxxe  
Cruxxe is a relatively small continent situated centrally upon 
Zyathé, and was once the home of the mythic, world-spanning 
Ethernic empire. In those days it was the most pleasant region 
in the world, and possessed perfectly tended habitats suitable 
for plants and creatures from across Zyathé. However, it is now a 
blasted wasteland. Few dare approach it, and fewer still return to 
speak of their experiences there, leaving its current state shroud -
ed in secrecy. None but monsters and abominations live upon its 
shores, while rumors speak of magical anomalies and seemingly 
impossible arcane ruins, but such things will remain trapped in 
the realm of speculation and tall tales as long as Cruxxe contin -
ues to be so lethally inaccessible.ablume  
Ablume covers the northern pole of Zyathé. It is a sizable land -
mass that is largely cloaked in snow and glaciers, though some 
of the coastal areas are just warm enough in the short summer 
months to support some robust grasses and shrubs. Animal life 
is similarly sparse and hardy, while settlements are mostly small 
villages. Some nearby islands are marginally more inhabitable, 
with the largest bearing the only city deserving of the name, 
which is populated by mixed-race outcasts of other lands, pri -
marily from Nordrukka. Adventurers come seeking hidden trea -
sures in the endless fields of white, but many succumb to the 
punishing blizzards, and most that survive leave empty handed.
sublume  
Sublume stretches across the southern pole of Zyathé. It is a 
large continent, and is quite similar to its northern counterpart 
in many ways. However, its coastline is somewhat warmer and 
more expansive, allowing for tracts of tundra that support more 
flora and fauna, as well as a number of barbarian tribes. Several 
varieties of Giants clash among the volcanic mountains further 
inland, and scattered geothermal vents create small oases of life 
amongst the trackless desolation. Many species of animals thrive 
and spread across the continent in vast colonies, usually relying 
upon the abundance of the sea for food. Rumors persist of a lost 
civilization secreted away somewhere upon Sublume, drawing 
many prospective explorers, but definitive evidence of it exis -
tence have yet to be found.

SOUTHERN ZYRANTHEA
The first published Gooey Cube adventure series, the 
Red Star Rising campaign, primarily takes place in the 
southern half of the Zyranthean Republic, a nation situ -
ated on the western coast of the continent of Verdestia. 
Although this region will be explored extensively in the 
upcoming second volume of the Cyclopaedia Zyathica: 
West Verdestia, this primer will give a brief glimpse into 
the notable features and locations of the region.
The jagged spire known as Mu’uz Derron rises near the 
center of the Zyranthean Republic, and is visible for hun -
dreds of miles around. Often used as a distant point of 
reference by travelers, the peak and surrounding hills 
are avoided by all sensible folk. Barren badlands extend 
for leagues around the strange rise, and the waters of the 
Murkflow river that descends its flanks are tainted with 
dark magic. Though many have forgotten or proposed al -
ternative explanations, the true origin of Mu’uz Derron is 
not entirely lost to history. The Ethernic city of Selenstiiril 
once graced the skies of Verdestia, but with the coming of 
the Woe of Ruin it fell to the earth far below like so many 
other marvels of that age. However, unlike many of the 
other floating cities, Selenstiiril turned completely over as 
it fell, burying the city deep in the ground while leaving its 
stony foundation a newly formed mountain piercing the 
skies of what would become the Republic in later days.
Although Mu’uz Derron is the most distinctive feature upon 
the landscape of Zyranthea, several others have consider -
able influence in shaping the lives of its inhabitants. Black -
rot Bog and Maggospit Marsh are two large quagmires 
which lie at the periphery of the Republic. The former re -
ceives the befouled runoff of the Murkflow, causing weird 
arcane anomalies and attracting foul, mutated creatures to 
its depths. Meanwhile Maggotspit remains relatively hale, 
but has almost no dry paths or navigable waterways, and is 
inhabited by territorial Algidians and other, more unusual 
creatures. Although many simply try to avoid these bayous, 
one of the major roads through the south is forced to pass 
through Blackrot Bog, while Maggospit Marsh is not far 
from either of the two major Zyranthean ports, Darken -
haven and Wavecrest, and its inhabitants have been known 
to stray into the surrounding countryside.
The Wyrmrest Mountains also act as a significant barrier, 
defining the entire eastern border of the Republic. These 
tall summits are well named, as they are home to nu -
merous dragons and their lesser kin, among many other 
creatures and monsters. Though several notable Dwarven 
cities exist at the base of the mountains, and often guard accompanying roads through the Underdelve to the other 
side, the Wyrmrests remain a  notable, and often danger -
ous, boundary for the people living in the area. This haz -
ardous frontier is compounded in its difficulty by the pres -
ence of the Feywyrd Forest, which begins in the foothills of 
the range but extends for many miles to the west. Although 
many smaller woodlands dot the land, the Feywyrd is large 
and ancient, full of deadly beasts and fonts of magic that 
seem to warp the flow of time. However, most significant -
ly, it is claimed by the warring Seelie and Unseelie Courts 
of the Fay’aree. Although the Light Fay’aree are not hostile 
to outsiders, few can endure their relentless mischief, and 
the ongoing war with their dark cousins has made the en -
tire forest a dangerous place for travelers.
By contrast, the rivers that run through the Republic often 
act as highways as much as obstructions. There are many 
waterways that crisscross Zyranthea, but the one that runs 
through the heart of the nation, both literally and figurative -
ly, is the Mystrune. This large river is fed by several smaller 
tributaries, and runs from north of the influential Dwarven 
city of Trundadelve in the northeast, through the country -
side and beside several significant cities. It continues to its 
breathtaking finish, where it rushes through the canals of 
the capital Darkenhaven and cascades over the cliffs where 
it joins the Mystranic ocean and the Undercurrent welling 
up from deep below in the cavernous Dunport beneath the 
city. The Mystrune acts as a vital link for trade and commu -
nication between the various member cities of the Republic.
As a republic, Zyranthea is largely defined by its member 
city-states. A significant number of these are located in 
the north and east, but as noted above, the grand capital 
of the nation, Darkenhaven, sprawls along the southwest -
ern coast. Countless ships continually pass through the 
unique harbor, known as the Dunport, which is located 
in the massive caverns beneath the city. People from all 
across Zyathé may be found in the bustling marketplaces 
of the city, where exotic goods from every continent are 
available, for the right price. The other two major cities of 
the south are Sundruun and Sundervulden, both located 
near the border with Andvalla. Sundruun is, in many ways, 
an outpost of decadent Andvallan culture and customs 
within the Republic, having broken away to join the pros -
perity of Zyranthea during a period of weakness for the 
old queendom of the south. Not far to the east is the other 
large Dwarven city of the Republic, Sundervulden. Though 
somewhat smaller and younger than Trundadelve, it is 
rapidly expanding and promises to produce many riches, 
both for its mining guilds and the wider nation.Ge o Gr a p h y  o f Th e W y’r d e d  W o r l dOPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a
